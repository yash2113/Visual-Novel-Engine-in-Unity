narrator "Lost in your thoughts, you don't immediately respond.{c} Arthur, never one to be ignored, lightly bumps your head with his fist." {c}

Arthur "Hey! Earth to <mainChar>! I'm asking about the game!" {c}

<mainChar> "Uh, yeah, about the game... Sorry, I haven't had the chance to play it yet." {c}

Arthur "Really? That's not like you." {c}

<mainChar> "Did you see the match yesterday? The Lakers vs. Warriors? That last-minute three-pointer was insane, right?" {c}

Arthur "Yeah, I couldn't believe it! That shot was incredible! I thought the Warriors had it in the bag, but the Lakers pulled through at the last second." {c}

narrator "As Arthur continues to rave about the game, you nod along, but your mind is elsewhere. The fact that you had perfectly predicted the events of the match in your dream only adds to your confusion." {c}

<mainChar> "Was it really just a dream?" {c}

narrator "The bell rings again, signaling the start of the next period.{c} As you gather your things, you can't shake the feeling that something strange is going on. You glance over at Stella once more, but she's already lost in her own world." {c}

narrator "The rest of the morning drags on, your thoughts constantly drifting back to the dream and the mysterious book. When lunchtime finally arrives, you find yourself hesitating." {c}

<mainChar> "I don't know, Arthur. It's been a weird morning, and I can't shake this feeling." {c}

<mainChar> "Of course. It's never just an ordinary book, is it? Is there a prophecy about it too?" {c}

Stella "This book contains powerful spells and ancient knowledge from a time long forgotten. It’s part of a collection known as the 'Codex of Shadows.'{c} Each volume in the Codex holds secrets that can alter the very fabric of reality." {c}

<mainChar> "Right, right. So, how exactly does this book alter reality? Can it make my homework disappear?" {c}

Stella "This particular book details the history and rituals of our city, how it was founded on ancient ley lines that channel mystical energies.{c} The founders used these energies to protect the city and ensure its prosperity." {c}

<mainChar> "So, it’s like a magical city maintenance manual. Do we also have a 'How to Care for Your Ancient Mystical Artifacts' guide?" {c}

Stella "In a way, yes. But it’s more than that. It contains warnings about what can happen if these energies are misused.{c} There’s a dark organization that wants to harness these powers for their own gain, and they won’t hesitate to harm anyone in their way." {c}

<mainChar> "Naturally. There's always a dark organization. They probably have a catchy evil slogan too." {c}

Stella "For now, we need to keep the book safe and stay alert.{c} I have a feeling the dark organization won’t stop until they get what they want. We’ll need to work together and be ready for anything." {c}
