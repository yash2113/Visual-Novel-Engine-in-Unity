Stella "Oh, you mean the one where they solved the crime with a cupcake? Classic detective work."

<mainChar> "Yeah, except in real life, cupcakes are my kryptonite. I'd be the worst detective ever."

Stella "Nonsense! You'd charm the suspects with your cupcake-loving ways."

Stella "Exactly! Speaking of mysteries, any progress on decoding Mrs. Johnson's math class?"

<mainChar> "Not yet. Her equations are like hieroglyphics. I'm pretty sure 'x' is the Egyptian symbol for 'why bother?'"

Stella "If only math was as easy as binge-watching shows."

<mainChar> "Or finding hidden treasure in video games. Speaking of which, did you check out that new game yet?"

Stella "Not yet. Saving it for a rainy day—or a boring math class."

<mainChar> "Smart move. So, any plans for after school today? More detective work or something else?"

Stella "Actually, I might have stumbled upon a clue that needs investigating. But first, breakfast. Cafeteria surprise or packed lunch?"

<mainChar> "Packed lunch all the way. The cafeteria might have secrets, but I'm not brave enough to uncover them."

Stella "Hey, when adventure calls, you answer with flair."

narrator "After some small talk, you and Stella get down to business."

<mainChar> "Alright, so what's the deal with this Whimsy Root?"

Stella "The Whimsy Root is said to have incredible persuasive powers.{c} If someone gets their hands on it, they could manipulate anyone into doing anything.{a} Imagine the chaos."

<mainChar> "Sounds like something straight out of a fantasy novel.{a} How did you even hear about this?"

Stella "A little birdie told me.{c} Well, more like a chatty janitor who doesn't know when to stop gossiping.{a} Anyway, we need to get it before someone else does."

<mainChar> "Okay, so where is this root hiding?"

Stella.SetSprite(11)

Stella "It's supposedly hidden in the garden section near the cafeteria.{c} But to get there, we'll need to break into the kitchen first."

<mainChar> "Why the kitchen?{c} Are we planning a heist or making a gourmet meal?"

Stella "Both, if we're lucky.{a} The garden area is locked during lunch hours,{c} and the only way to access it is through the kitchen.{c} Plus, the kitchen staff takes a break around 12:20,{c} so we'll have a small window of opportunity."

<mainChar> "Great,{c} so how do we break into the kitchen without getting caught?"

Stella "First, we need a distraction.{c} Something big enough to draw the cafeteria staff away from the kitchen entrance.{c} Any ideas?"

<mainChar> "Well, I do have a few tricks up my sleeve.{a} How about we stage a food fight?"

Stella "Too risky.{c} We need something more subtle,{c} but still effective."

<mainChar> "How about a fire alarm?{c} Classic,{c} but it might get us in serious trouble."

Stella "True.{c} We need something that's just chaotic enough.{a} What if we pretend someone found a bug in their food?{a} That always freaks people out."

<mainChar> "Gross,{a} but effective.{c} I like it.{c} So, who’s going to be the brave soul to 'discover' this bug?"

Stella "I'll do it.{c} While everyone is distracted,{c} you sneak into the kitchen and unlock the garden door from the inside."

<mainChar> "Got it.{c} But what if someone catches me?"

Stella "Just act like you’re looking for the bathroom.{c} Kitchens and bathrooms are basically the same,{a} right?"

<mainChar> "Sure, if you ignore the distinct lack of toilets in one.{c} Alright, let's run through the plan again."

Stella "Step one: I cause a commotion by 'finding' a bug in my food.{c} Step two: While everyone is distracted,{a} you sneak into the kitchen and unlock the garden door.{c} Step three: We meet in the garden and locate the Whimsy Root."

<mainChar> "Sounds simple enough.{c} What could possibly go wrong?"

Stella "Don't jinx it.{a} Now,{c} we need to time this perfectly.{c} The staff takes their break at exactly 12:20.{c} We need to be in position by 12:15."

<mainChar> "Alright,{a} I'll head to the cafeteria and find a good spot to keep an eye on things.{c} You get ready to unleash the 'bug' surprise."

Stella "Let’s synchronize our... oh wait, we still don't have watches."

<mainChar> "Right,{a} we'll just use our phones.{c} Meet you at the cafeteria in ten minutes."
