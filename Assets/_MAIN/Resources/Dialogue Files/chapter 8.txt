Stella "Aliens would’ve been a cakewalk.{c} I was on a treacherous journey through the depths of the city’s underground.{c} You wouldn’t believe the things I saw."

<mainChar> "Did you have to battle sewer monsters?"

Stella "Close. Laser security systems."

<mainChar> "Of course. Every city has those in the sewers."

Stella "And I had to decode hieroglyphs."

<mainChar> "Naturally. Ancient Egyptians loved to hang out in the subway."

Stella "There was a high-speed chase with a shadowy figure."

<mainChar> "I bet he had a British accent."

Stella "Laugh all you want, but look what I found."

<mainChar> "If you say it's the Holy Grail, I’m out of here."

Stella "Relax. This is a state-of-the-art tracking device. It can detect important items and pinpoint their location."

<mainChar> "Great. Just what we needed: a gadget that looks like it’s one bad wire away from becoming a fire hazard."

Stella "You’re such a skeptic."

<mainChar> "Skeptic? More like realist. This thing looks like it was made by a mad scientist on a caffeine binge."

Stella "Well, we’ll find out soon enough."

<mainChar> "Or we’ll end up on the evening news."

Stella "Relax.{c} This is a state-of-the-art tracking device.{c} It can detect important items and pinpoint their location."

<mainChar> "If you say so.{c} But if I get zapped, I’m blaming you."

Stella "Watch and learn."

narrator "Stella activates the gadget, and it emits a series of high-pitched beeps before sparking wildly."

Stella "It’s just calibrating."

narrator "Suddenly, the gadget starts shaking violently and emits a puff of smoke."

<mainChar> "Sure, calibrating.{c} And here I thought it was having a seizure."

narrator "Stella frowns, adjusting some wires and fiddling with the device.{c} The gadget lets out a loud screech, causing both of you to cover your ears."

<mainChar> "Okay, this is starting to sound like a banshee.{c} What next,{a} it starts summoning ghosts?"

Stella "I think I just need to tweak the settings."
